# Hey there ! I am Rachel :)
> An assistant written in `Python` Version `0.1.0` !
<hr>

Anyway , I can't do difficult stuff , but I am a lovely Assistant !
> There is no MySQL in This version :)
> \
> In this case we use <a href="https://github.com/manijamali2003/pyabr">PyAbr</a> Database Extension named Control .

There are some Python Modules you need to install .
You can see them <a href="https://github.com/BlackIQ/Rachel/blob/master/requirements.txt">Here</a> .

> You should install Rachel in your computer and for test just run <a href="https://github.com/BlackIQ/Rachel/blob/master/debug.py">`debug.py`</a>

<hr>

#### So , Lets start
First you have to install linux packages :

`sudo pacman -S espeak ffmpeg mpg123 git`

> Use your own package manager .
 
now clone and install requirements .

```
git clone https://github.com/BlackIQ/Rachel && cd Rachel
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Ok , now you can install Rachel .

```
python3 setup.py
```

How to run ?

```
Rachel
```

<hr>

#### Important !

There are 2 main files . Core.py and Rachel.py .

Core is in `packs/rachel/code/core.py`
\
Rachel is in `packs/rachel/code/rachel.py`

###### Core :
Everything is in Core . I mean functions .
###### Rachel
Rachel file gets commands and run functions from core.py

You shoud change Core and Ashley . So , for test ( debug ) run this command :

`python3 debug.py`
